abstract: "Exemplary methods, apparatuses, and systems determine that a geolocation of a first mobile device is within a threshold distance from a geolocation of a second mobile device. In response, a list of one or more mobile devices within the threshold distance from the geolocation of the second mobile device, including the first mobile device, are transmitted to the second mobile device. A selection of the first mobile device from the list is received from the second mobile device. A request from the second mobile device to transmit a payment from an account associated with the second mobile device to an account associated with the first mobile device is received from the second mobile device. A confirmation of the requested payment is transmitted to the second mobile device."
